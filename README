Experimental Stored Procedure Implementation in SQLite 
(based on 3.7.3)

Chris Wolf, cw10025 AT gmail.com, 1 January 2011

The master "git" branch is just an unmodified open of pysqlite-2.6.0; the 
"sproc-1" branch has the modifications required for sqlite-3.7.3 built
with --enable-stored-procedures and the sqlite-3.7.3/ext/pyproc 
loadable extension to support Python stored procedures.

This implementation for Python stored procs is accomplished by  
creating a Python interpreter instance; then taking the current 
connection, (of type sqlite3*) and sticking this pointer value 
into a Python global variable named “sqlite3_db_handle”, so that 
the modified pysqlite2 module can access it when it instantiates 
a “dbapi2.connection” with zero arguments. (Normally, at least 
one argument is required) 

Building/Install:

python setup.py install

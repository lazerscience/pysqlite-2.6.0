Experimental Stored Procedure Implementation in SQLite 
(based on 3.7.3)

Chris Wolf, cw10025 AT gmail.com, 1 January 2011

The master "git" branch is just an unmodified open of pysqlite-2.6.0; the 
"sproc-1" branch has the modifications required for sqlite-3.7.3 built
with --enable-stored-procedures and the sqlite-3.7.3/ext/pyproc 
loadable extension to support Python stored procedures.

Building/Install:

python setup.py install
